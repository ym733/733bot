## TextEditCommands

_These commands sole purpose to alter the appearance of input._

_The intended use for these commands is to use them for chaining commands, as to alter the appearance of the final output by the bot._

_To chain commands together we separate the commands with '|' and the output of the first command will go to the next and so on._

_Ex: "??ping | bold"_
