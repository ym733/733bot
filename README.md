## Info

_This is a Twitch chat web-socket client written in ruby, used by **733bot**, which is a bot I host with this client locally._

_This is not the original code I use to host 733bot but a very close replica._

_I have made many changes to this open source code throughout._

_733bot is not active 24/7._

## Open-Source Commands

_I have a couple commands to go along with my twitch bot since my bot is a chat bot_
