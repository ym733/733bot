## Info

_This is a Twitch chat web-socket client written in ruby, used by **733bot**, which is a bot I host with this client locally._

_This is not the original code I use to host 733bot but a very close replica._

_I have made many changes to this open source code throughout._

_733bot is not active 24/7._

## Open-Source Commands

_I have a couple commands to go along with my twitch bot since my bot is a chat bot_

## Documentation for config.json

_oauth is like your password to the bot, you can get an oauth token from the following website [_Twitch Chat Password Generator_](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/)_

_username is your bot's twtich username exactly as it is written on twitch, this helps with the identity verification_

_channel is the channel you want the bot to join (this open-source code only supports one channel)_

_db_params are your parameters to allow the bot to connect to your database (not neccesary here, so it's okay to leave empty)_
